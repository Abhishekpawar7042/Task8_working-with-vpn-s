#Task 8 - Working with VPNs

#Objective
To understand how Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) help in protecting online privacy and securing network communication by encrypting traffic and hiding IP addresses.

#Tools Used
-ProtonVPN 

#Steps Followed

*Connecting to VPN Server
- Clicked on *Quick Connect* to connect automatically.  
  (Connected to a Netherlands server)
- VPN status turned Connected.

*Verifying IP Address
- Before connection → Checked real IP on [https://whatismyipaddress.com](https://whatismyipaddress.com)
- After VPN connection → Checked new IP (changed to Netherlands location)

#Testing Secure Connection
- Opened a few websites (e.g., `https://example.com`, YouTube).  
- All websites worked fine — confirmed encrypted tunnel active.

*Disconnecting & Speed Check
- Disconnected VPN and ran a speed test.  
- Noted that VPN slightly reduced the speed due to encryption overhead.

#Research on VPN
- Encryption Used: AES-256-bit encryption  
- Protocols: OpenVPN, IKEv2/IPSec, WireGuard  
- Data Protection: Prevents ISP tracking, secures public Wi-Fi traffic, hides IP from websites

#VPN Benefits
- Hides real IP address  
- Encrypts internet traffic  
- Prevents ISP & public Wi-Fi tracking  
- Helps access geo-restricted content  
- Provides secure communication tunnel  

#VPN Limitations
- Internet speed may slow down  
- Free VPNs may have limited servers or data limits  
- Complete anonymity not guaranteed  
- Some VPNs may log user activity  

#Summary
Using a VPN ensures privacy by encrypting network communication and masking your IP address. It creates a secure tunnel between the device and the VPN server, protecting data from interception. However, users should prefer trusted VPNs and understand their privacy policies before using them.
